Led and collaborated with a diverse team of healthcare analysts to explore readmission data from various hospitals across Virginia. Our primary objective was to investigate the relationships between a wide range of factors and readmission rates in these hospitals, with a specific focus on the aspects of safety, effectiveness, and timeliness of care. 
Our goal was to gain insights into readmission trends and suggest strategies for improving patient outcomes while reducing readmission rates.
To effectively communicate our findings, we generated compelling data visualizations using Tableau. Our visual materials included interactive data graphs, dashboards, and reports that highlighted the key insights and trends identified in the data.
